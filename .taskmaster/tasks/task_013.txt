# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize AI Response Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement techniques to improve AI response time and reliability.
# Details:
1. Implement response caching for common queries
2. Set up a job queue for long-running AI tasks (use Celery 5.3.0+ with Redis)
3. Implement streaming responses for faster initial display
4. Optimize prompts for each agent type
5. Implement fallback mechanisms for AI service disruptions
6. Set up monitoring and logging for AI performance metrics

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing with various query types and loads. Measure and compare response times before and after optimizations. Test fallback mechanisms by simulating AI service failures.
