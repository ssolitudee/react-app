# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository and set up the development environment for both frontend and backend.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository
2. Create project structure with separate frontend and backend directories:
   ```
   inventory-analyzer-ai/
   ├── frontend/         # React application
   ├── backend/          # FastAPI application
   └── README.md
   ```
3. Set up a React project in the frontend directory using Create React App v5.1.0 with React v18.2.0
4. Initialize a Python virtual environment (Python 3.11+) in the backend directory
5. Set up FastAPI v0.115.12 with Uvicorn v0.29.0 in the backend directory
6. Configure ESLint v8.56.0 and Prettier v3.2.5 for the frontend project
7. Install Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 in the frontend project
8. Create a README.md at the project root with setup instructions for both frontend and backend
9. Ensure Node.js v22.16.0 and npm v10.9.2 are used for frontend development

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all development tools are correctly installed and configured by running test commands for each (e.g., `npm start` for the React frontend, `uvicorn main:app --reload` for the FastAPI backend). Also verify that Tailwind CSS is properly configured by testing a simple styled component. Confirm Node.js v22.16.0 and npm v10.9.2 are correctly installed and being used for the project.
