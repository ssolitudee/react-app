# Title: Build LangChain-based Chatbot Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a chatbot backend with two specialized agents using LangChain and GPT-4o mini.
# Details:
1. Install LangChain v0.1.11 and required dependencies
2. Connect backend to GPT-4o mini LLM and verify it provides answers
3. Implement Summary Agent that can condense information
4. Implement Chatbot Agent with a financial advisor prompt
5. Add agent selection logic for switching between agents
6. Add error handling and response formatting

# Test Strategy:
Test direct connection to GPT-4o mini to verify API integration. Test each agent with sample queries and verify appropriate responses. Ensure the agent selection works correctly based on request type. Test error handling for API failures and invalid requests.
