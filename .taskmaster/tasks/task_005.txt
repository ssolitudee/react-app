# Task ID: 5
# Title: Set Up LangChain Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate LangChain into the backend for AI processing and agent specialization.
# Details:
1. Install LangChain v0.1.11 and required dependencies
2. Set up connection to language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo)
3. Create base agent class with common functionality
4. Implement Summary Agent for concise data analysis using LangChain's summarization capabilities
5. Implement Chatbot Agent for interactive conversations using LangChain's conversational chains
6. Create factory method for agent selection and specialization
7. Implement prompt templates for each agent type
8. Create utility functions for processing inventory data
9. Implement proper error handling for AI responses

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for agent creation and specialization. Test with sample inputs to ensure correct agent behavior and output formatting. Include tests for inventory data processing utilities and error handling mechanisms.
