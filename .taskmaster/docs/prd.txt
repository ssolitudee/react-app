# Inventory Analyzer AI - Product Requirements Document

## Overview  
Inventory Analyzer AI is a fullstack web application featuring an AI chatbot designed to help users analyze inventory data. The application provides two specialized AI agents - a Summary Agent for concise data analysis and a Chatbot Agent for interactive conversations. The platform stores chat histories for future reference and offers quick access to frequently asked questions.

## Core Features  
### 1. Interactive Chat Interface
- What it does: Provides a clean, intuitive interface for users to interact with AI agents
- Why it's important: Creates a seamless user experience and makes complex inventory analysis accessible
- How it works: React-based frontend with real-time message display and history tracking

### 2. Dual AI Agents
- What it does: Offers two specialized AI agents (Summary Agent and Chatbot Agent)
- Why it's important: Provides flexibility for different user needs - quick summaries vs. detailed conversations
- How it works: LangChain-powered AI integration with specialized prompting for each agent type

### 3. Chat History Management
- What it does: Stores and displays previous conversations in a sidebar
- Why it's important: Allows users to reference past analyses and continue previous conversations
- How it works: Persistent storage of chat logs with easy navigation and retrieval

### 4. FAQ Quick Access
- What it does: Displays common inventory analysis questions in a 2x2 grid
- Why it's important: Speeds up common queries and helps new users understand system capabilities
- How it works: Pre-configured questions that auto-populate the chat input when selected

## User Experience  
### User Personas
1. Inventory Managers - Need quick insights into inventory status and trends
2. Supply Chain Analysts - Require detailed analysis of inventory movement and forecasting
3. Operation Teams - Need straightforward answers to inventory-related questions

### Key User Flows
1. New Chat Initiation
   - User lands on welcome screen
   - Selects agent type (Summary or Chatbot)
   - Begins conversation or selects FAQ

2. Chat Interaction
   - User sends messages
   - AI responds with appropriate analysis
   - Welcome screen is replaced with conversation thread

3. History Navigation
   - User views sidebar list of previous chats
   - Selects a chat to continue
   - Reviews previous conversation context

### UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, modern interface with clear hierarchy, darker color themes clean and nice
- Prominent display of chatbot name at the top
- Color-coded elements ("Hi" in darker red, "Inventory Analyzer AI" in white)
- Responsive design for various device sizes
- Clear visual distinction between user and AI messages

## Technical Architecture  
### System Components
1. Frontend
   - React for component-based UI
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Context API for state management

2. Backend
   - FastAPI/Flask Python server
   - RESTful API endpoints for chat functionality
   - WebSocket support for real-time chatting (optional)

3. AI Integration
   - LangChain for chatbot framework
   - Integration with language models
   - Agent specialization logic

4. Data Storage
   - Database for chat history persistence
   - User session management

### Data Models
1. Chat
   - ID (unique identifier)
   - Title (auto-generated from content)
   - Created timestamp
   - Last updated timestamp
   - Agent type used

2. Message
   - ID (unique identifier)
   - Chat ID (foreign key)
   - Content (text)
   - Role (user/assistant)
   - Timestamp
   - Metadata (optional)

### APIs and Integrations
1. `/chat` - Main endpoint for sending and receiving messages
2. `/history` - Retrieve chat history
3. `/faq` - Get predefined FAQ questions
4. Integration with LangChain for AI processing

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Hosting for React frontend
- Python server deployment
- Database for chat storage
- Optional caching layer for performance

## Development Roadmap  
### MVP Requirements
1. Basic UI Implementation
   - Landing page with welcome message
   - Agent selection buttons
   - Chat input and display
   - Simple sidebar for history

2. Core Chat Functionality
   - Message sending and receiving
   - Agent type selection
   - Basic conversation flow

3. Initial AI Integration
   - LangChain setup
   - Basic agent differentiation
   - Text response generation

### Future Enhancements
1. Advanced Features
   - Rich message formatting
   - File upload for inventory data
   - Data visualization components
   - User authentication and profiles

2. Performance Optimizations
   - Response caching
   - Optimized loading states
   - Pagination for chat history

3. Extended Capabilities
   - Additional specialized agents
   - Integration with inventory management systems
   - Export functionality for chat logs and analyses

## Logical Dependency Chain
1. Foundation (Build First)
   - Frontend project setup with React and Tailwind
   - Basic UI components and layout
   - Backend API structure with FastAPI/Flask

2. Core Functionality
   - Chat interface implementation
   - Message display and input handling
   - Sidebar and history UI components

3. AI Integration
   - LangChain setup in backend
   - Agent specialization logic
   - Connection between frontend and AI backend

4. Enhanced Features
   - FAQ section implementation
   - Chat history persistence
   - UI refinements and responsiveness

## Risks and Mitigations  
### Technical Challenges
- Risk: AI response latency affecting user experience
  Mitigation: Implement optimistic UI updates and loading states

- Risk: Complexity in managing different agent behaviors
  Mitigation: Clear abstraction layer in LangChain implementation

### MVP Scope
- Risk: Feature creep extending development timeline
  Mitigation: Strictly prioritize core functionality for initial release

- Risk: Frontend-backend integration complexities
  Mitigation: Clear API contracts and comprehensive testing

### Resource Constraints
- Risk: Limited AI model performance
  Mitigation: Optimize prompts and consider model fine-tuning

- Risk: Scalability concerns with growing chat history
  Mitigation: Implement efficient data storage and retrieval patterns

## UI Mockup Description
- Header: Chatbot name at top, "New Chat" button on right
- Sidebar: Vertical list of historical chats on left
- Welcome Screen: Firm logo, welcome message with "Hi" in darker red, "Inventory Analyzer AI" in white
- Agent Selection: Two buttons - "Summary Agent" and "Chatbot Agent"
