# GPT-4o Mini Financial Advisor Agent Implementation Steps

This document outlines the specific implementation steps for creating both the Financial Advisor agent and Summary agent using LangChain and GPT-4o mini. Use this guide alongside the LANGCHAIN_GPT4O_SETUP.md document to replicate the implementation in your corporate environment.

## Financial Advisor Agent Implementation

### Initial Setup
1. Create the base LLM service for connecting to GPT-4o mini
2. Set up OpenAI API key and model name using environment variables
3. Implement conversation memory using LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory
4. Configure appropriate temperature and other settings for financial advisor responses

### Prompt Engineering
1. Add a specific financial advisor prompt prefix to the chatbot agent
2. Craft the prompt to specify the agent's role and expertise
3. Format user messages with appropriate context
4. Include error handling for API failures

### Integration Steps
1. Register the financial advisor agent in the AI service manager
2. Set it as the default chatbot agent
3. Connect agent to the `/chat` API endpoint 
4. Handle message formatting between frontend and LLM

## Summary Agent Implementation

### Implementation Process
1. Create a separate handler for summary requests in the AI service
2. Configure the summary agent to process multiple messages at once
3. Implement special prompt engineering for summarization tasks
4. Include proper error handling specific to summary agent

### Data Processing Steps
1. Extract all relevant messages from chat history
2. Format conversation content for summarization
3. Process the LLM response for display in the frontend
4. Handle edge cases like empty history

## Testing Procedure

### Backend Testing
1. Start by testing the LLM connection using the `/test-llm` endpoint
2. Verify API responses contain expected format and content
3. Test with various financial questions to ensure proper understanding
4. Check summary functionality with different conversation lengths

### Frontend Integration Testing
1. Verify chat messages are sent and received correctly
2. Test loading states during API calls
3. Confirm optimistic UI updates work as expected
4. Check agent switching functionality (if implemented)

## Deployment Considerations

1. Ensure proper error handling for production environment
2. Consider rate limiting to manage API costs
3. Implement request logging for diagnostics
4. Monitor API usage and response quality

## Additional Notes

- Remember to keep your OpenAI API key secure and never commit it to version control
- Consider implementing a fallback mechanism for when the API is unavailable
- The context window for GPT-4o mini is limited, so design your prompts accordingly
- For production deployment, consider more robust error handling and retry logic
